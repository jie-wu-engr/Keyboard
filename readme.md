# VaKeyboard
As usual, I started with this project because I couldn't find keyboard I'd like to use.

This project is trying to build following:
- TKL keyboard with Cherry MX switches.
- RGB LEDs under each key, individually controllable from connected device.
- Bluetooth 5.0.
- Charging through USB-C.
- Ionidized aluminium frame of Filco Majestouch 2 design.

Side features:
- PCB dimension's compatible with Filco Majestouch 2.
- Modularity
  - Main PCB doesn't have microcontroller/bluetooth/...
  - It's purely switches + RGB leds with IO expanders and LED drivers connectable through I2C.
