# Keyboard overview
As usual, I started with this project because I couldn't find keyboard I'd like to use.

This project is trying to build following:
- TKL hotswap keyboard for Cherry MX switches.
- RGB LEDs under each switch (individually controllable from connected device).
- Bluetooth 5.0.
- Charging through USB-C.
- Anodized aluminium frame of Filco Majestouch 2 design.

Side features:
- Except of LED drivers & sockets everything is on front side for soldering on JCLPCB side.
- Modularity - All logic chips are on separate modules. Main PCB contains just RGB LEDs, sockets and IO expanders with LED drivers.

# Current status
[Revision 1](changelog.md) is in development, check details about the [build](docs/build.md)!

Currently are developed all features of this project except of:
- Bluetooth 5.0.
- Charging through USB-C.
- Anodized aluminium frame of Filco Majestouch 2 design.

Thou current version is not tested yet. I will have current version of PCB & plate in couple of weeks, then I'll update this post.
