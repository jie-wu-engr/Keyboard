# Future plans

## Short term
### QMK
- Rev 1 keyboard is working now with QMK firmware, but bluetooth is not functional as when BT is enabled, keyboard scanning stop to work for some reason (will follow up on it).
- Rev 2 firmware in progress.

## Long term
- adding status LEDs or tiny colorful display (if I find some which fits into existing space, this is preferable solution).
- switch for turning keyboard on and off
- better microcontroller with USB-C and more program storage
- gyroscope / accelerometer for movement detection for optimizing wake up experience
- fingerprint sensor
